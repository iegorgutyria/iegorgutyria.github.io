        <button class="accordion">
          <p>1. How long does it take for makeup application
           the day of my event? And why is there a difference in pricing for
           the brides makeup?</p>
         </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Bridal makeup takes about 1 hour to apply. For each "bridesmaid"
            or "other" I like to spend around 30 min. per person. I spend more
            time on the bride to ensure her makeup is extremely detailed and
            perfected and I use a higher quality brand of false lashes on the
            bride. I have 15 years of makeup experience and I use high
            quality makeup brands in my kit. This also determines my fees. </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><p>2. How do you figure out the makeup application
            start and finish time?</p></button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>I gauge the timing by the above outline. From there I will decide
            what time I need to arrive by to be able to have everyone completed
            on time. The start and finish time is also based upon my availability.
            There are times when I have more than one job to complete in one day.
            If you have a bridal party of more than 8 I will also determine if
            I need to bring another MUA assistant to take some of the makeup
            applications at no extra fee. I will always do the bridal makeup
            myself. </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><p>3. How long will my makeup last?</p></button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Your makeup should last at least 12 hours if not LONGER!</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><p>4. If I cry will it mess up my makeup?</p></button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Yes, it can. At the end of the day makeup is makeup. It can smudge
             from tears or wiping from a tissue however, all of the products I
             use are waterproof or water resistant. So this should definitely
             help combat any disruptions. And always remember to PAT, never wipe!</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><p>5. What brand of cosmetics do you use?</p></button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>98% of my makeup kit is MAC Cosmetics. The false lashes I use are
             typically by Ardell or Salon Perfect. I only use strip lashes.
             No individual lashes will be applied. </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><p>6. Do you provide a non latex lash glue for
              people with a latex allergy?</p></button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Yes, I do. Please ask everyone in your bridal party to disclose if
             they have a latex allergy so I can be sure to have my non latex glue
             option available for that individual.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><p>7. If there is a makeup / false lashes that I
          personally love, can I bring it and have you apply it?</p></button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Sure can!</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><p>8. How do I touch up my makeup after you leave?</p></button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>I can go over any concerns you may have during your trial and before
            I leave the day of your wedding. If there are products I used on you
            that you absolutely love and want to have on hand after I leave you
            are more than welcome to purchase those items from me. Just let me
            know what you're loving or feel like you might need.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><p>9. When is my payment due for the wedding?</p></button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>When I send you the makeup agreement you will have a deposit.
             The deposit charge is typically the travel fee. The day of your
              wedding your remaining balance is due in full before any makeup
              is started. The remaining balance can be paid in cash, Venmo or
               via PayPal as sending money to a "friend".</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><p>10. What if I need to cancel my event and I have already signed the makeup agreement and sent my deposit?</p></button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>As it states in the agreement, the deposit is non refundable.
            If you do need to cancel your reservation, you will not be charged
             further. If I need to forfeit the agreement for any reason, you will
             be fully refunded for any payments made regarding your event and I will
             do my best to help find you a replacement MUA (this is a very un-likely
             situation to occur.)</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><p>11. How do you determine the cost for your travel fee?</p></button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>I typically charge about $1 per mile for one way. I also need to take
             into consideration if there will be any tolls or parking fees at your
              venue. Please keep in mind traveling to your location involves more
               than just driving there! There is a lot of packing and preparation
                that is involved to be sure everything is ready for you!</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><p>12. Do you do hair?</p></button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>No, I am not a hair stylist. I am happy to refer you to hair stylists I have worked with.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><p>13. Should we do hair or makeup first?</p></button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>I have no preference. It works either way. </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><p>14. When should I schedule my makeup trial?</p></button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p> I suggest booking your trial for a day when you have an event to
             attend such as, your bridal shower, wedding shower, bachelorette
              party etc. It's also a great idea to schedule your trial for the
               day you will be taking your engagement photos! This is great
                because you can see how your makeup will look in your photographers
                 editing style.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><p>15. Do I have to have a makeup trial?</p></button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>No you do not. You can view my makeovers on my instagram or
             facebook pages to get a feel for my makeup application style and technique. </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><p>16. Will the cost of my makeup trial be deducted from my wedding total?</p></button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>No. The makeup trial is a separate makeup application and will be
            an individual cost with a separate contract from your wedding contract.
             This is not deducted from your wedding cost. That is why I suggest
              you use your trial for an event or photoshoot. </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><p>17. How do I find an example of makeup that
           I like to show you how I want my makeup to look and do I have
            to have an example if I really don't know?</p></button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>You can find tons of makeup pictures on social media. On instagram,
             you can search hashtags such as #bridalmakeup and look through those.
              Pintrest is also a popular spot to find inspiration, even simply
              just google searching "wedding makeup" works! And if you truly
               have no preference or idea on how you want your makeup to look,
                I am more than happy to figure it out with you! Please feel free
                 to DM me makeup inspiration pictures if you have any!</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><p>18. Do you apply airbrush makeup?</p></button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>No. In my professional opinion, the end result of the overall
             look of the makeup application has little to  no difference. Airbrush
              is also always a water based formula which creates minimum coverage.
               So for someone that wants a more full coverage look, which is almost
                everyone, you would have to build products up on top of the foundation.
                 Airbrush makeup is also more time consuming to apply and clean the spray
                  gun after each use. Therefore, I only apply traditional, hand applied makeup. </p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion"><p>19. Do you require a min. or max. for total people needing makeup.</p></button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p> There is no max. amount of people because I can always bring an
             assistant or two however, I do ask that at least 4 people total are
              getting makeup applied the day of the wedding.</p>
